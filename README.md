# DifferentialRegulation_manuscript
This repository contains the code used for the analyses presented in the manuscript "DifferentialRegulation: a Bayesian hierarchical approach to identify differentially regulated genes", which presents the R/Bioconductor package DifferentialRegulation.

The code is organized in 3 folders:

- BULK SIMULATION, which contains the scripts to run the bulk RNA-seq data simulation;

- SINGLE-CELL SIMULATION, that includes the scripts to run the single-cell RNA-seq data simulation;

- REAL DATA, which has the scripts to run the real data analysis.
